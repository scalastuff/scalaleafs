Scala Leafs is an open-source server-side framework for scala to build rich, interactive, ajax-enabled web applications. 

Scala Leafs is **minimalistic**; its purpose is to create web applications and nothing else. It is **unobtrusive**; it doesn't force your application into any structure and plays nice with other libraries. It is **developer oriented**; developing rich web applications should be fast and easy for the average scala developer.


Some notable features:

- Clean separation between HTML and code.
- Transparent Ajax support.
- Automatic partial page updates.
- Integrated support for History API.
